Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Created by Robert Hamby, September 2018

Rock, paper, scissors project is part of TheOdinProject.com's Web Development 101
course. 

This is a basic rock paper scissors game to play between a player and the
computer. The computer has no logic other than to randomly generate a number 
in order to select rock, paper, or scissors.

The game originally has five rounds, which displays a winner after the player
or the computer win three rounds or five rounds are complete.

This program demonstrates basic javascript logic, using loops and conditionals as well as functions to break apart the code into smaller, more digestible segments for
readability and less errors.
